		<summary>What is a coronavirus?</summary>
		<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.
		In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe
		diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). 
		The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>

		<summary>What is COVID-19?</summary>
		<p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and
		disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.</p>
		</details>
		<hr color="blue">
		<details>
		<summary>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</summary>
		<p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common
		and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, 
		loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
		Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.</p>

 <div>Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospita  l treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people 
 who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
 like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.
 However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated
 withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. 
 If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.</div>

		<details>
		<summary>What should i do if i have COVID-19 symptoms and when should i seek medical care?</summary>
		<p>If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate
		and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.</p>

<div>However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.  Seek medical help.
  When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distance from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands.
  If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.
</div>
<div>Seek immediate medical care if you have difficulty breathing or pain/pressure in the chest. If possible, call your health care provider
 in advance, so he/she can direct you to the right health facility.</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does COVID-19 spread?</summary>
<p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small
 droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are
 relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets
 from a person infected with the virus.  This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter) away from others. These droplets can
 land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails.  People can become infected by touching these 
 objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and
 water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub.</p>

<div>WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways that COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.</div>

<details>
<summary>Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</summary>
<p>COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing or has other symptoms such as fever 
or tiredness. Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true in the early stages of the disease.
 It is possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has just a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>

<p>Some reports have indicated that people with no symptoms can transmit the virus. It is not yet known how often it happens.
 WHO is assessing ongoing research on the topic and will continue to share updated findings.
</p>

<details>
<summary>How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</summary>
<p>Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.</p>
<p>When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others. This is especially important if you are 
standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing.  Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their
 symptoms may be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating.</p>
</details>
<hr color="blue">
<details>
<summary>What should i do if i have come in close contact with someone who has COVID-19?</summary>
<p>If you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, you may be infected.</p>

<p>Close contact means that you live with or have been in settings of less than 1 metre from those who have the disease.
 In these cases, it is best to stay at home.</p>

<p>However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. 
Seek medical help. When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people
 and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.</p>

<p>If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you become ill, even with very mild symptoms you must self-isolate
<li>Even if you don’t think you have been exposed to COVID-19 but develop symptoms, then self-isolate and monitor yourself
<li>You are more likely to infect others in the early stages of the disease when you just have mild symptoms, therefore early self-isolation is very important.
<li>If you do not have symptoms, but have been exposed to an infected person, self-quarantine for 14 days.
</ul>

<p>If you have definitely had COVID-19 (confirmed by a test) self-isolate for 14 days even after symptoms have disappeared as 
a precautionary measure – it is not yet known exactly how long people remain infectious after they have recovered. Follow national advice on self-isolation.</p>
</details>
<hr color="blue">
<details>
<summary>What does it mean to self-isolate?</summary>
<p>Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members.</p>

<p>Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work,
 school or public places. This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care provider’s recommendation. However, if you live in an 
 area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. Seek medical help. When you attend the health 
 facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who 
 is sick help the child stick to this advice.</p>
<p>
If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:</p>

<p>-  If a person is in self-isolation, it is because he/she is ill but not severely ill (requiring medical attention)</p>
<ul>
<li>have a large, well-ventilated with hand-hygiene and toilet facilities
<li>If this is not possible, place beds at least 1 metre apart
<li>Keep at least 1 metre from others, even from your family members
<li>Monitor your symptoms daily
<li>Isolate for 14 days, even if you feel healthy
<li>If you develop difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately – call them first if possible
<li>Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.
</ul>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between self-isolation, self-quarantine and distancing?</summary>
<p>Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19. 
The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when people just develop symptoms..</p>

<p>Isolation means separating people who are ill with symptoms of COVID-19 and may be infectious to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>Physical distancing means being physically apart. WHO recommends keeping at least 1-metre distance from others. 
This is a general measure that everyone should take even if they are well with no known exposure to COVID-19. </p>
</details>
<hr color="blue">
<details>
<summary>Is there  a vaccine ,drug or treatment for COVID-19?</summary>
<p>While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, 
there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, 
including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional

 medicines. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated
 information as soon research results become available.</p>

<p>The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean your hands frequently and thoroughly
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose
<li>Cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue. If a tissue is used, discard it immediately and wash your hands.
<li>Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre from others. 
</ul>

<details>
<summary>How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</summary>
<p>The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants
 that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, 
 less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.</p>

<p>As, always clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>

<details>
<summary>How to wash fruits and vegetables?</summary>
<p>Fruits and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet. Wash them the same way you should do under any circumstance:
 before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then, wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw.</p>
